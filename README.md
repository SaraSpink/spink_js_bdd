# _Maturing in the Milky Way_
### A solar year lasts 365 days on planet Earth. Calculate your exact age and find out your age on other planets.
## By Sara Spink
## Expected Behavior:

| Behavior                             | Input | Output   |
|--------------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Convert your age into earth seconds! | 1     | 31536000 |
| Convert your age into Mercury years. | 3     | 0.72     |
| Convert your age into Venus years.   | 3     | 1.86     |
| Convert your age into Mars years.    | 3     | 5.64     |
| Convert your age into Jupiter years. | 3     | 35.58    |
|--------------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Enter your birthday to see your age right now in Earth years. | "3/17/1984" | 33  |
| Enter your birthday to see your age in right now in seconds. | "3/17/1984" (entered on 10/13/2017)   | approx. 1059574349  |
_Take two dates and determine the difference, in seconds, between the two. (This way a user can enter a birthdate and the application can compare the birthdate against the current time to come up with an accurate age.)_


Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet… (yikes!) To do this, the application will have to calculate the user’s life expectancy. (Note that life expectancy shouldn’’t be a hard-coded value. After all, it can vary from country to country and depending on various demographics.)

If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, your application should account for (and test) this possible outcome as well.
