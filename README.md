# _Maturing in the Milky Way_
### A solar year lasts 365 days on planet Earth. Calculate your exact age and find out your age on other planets.
## By Sara Spink
## Description/User Stories:


Convert your age into earth seconds!

Return the age of a human in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)

Return the age of a human in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)

Return the age of a human in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)

Return the age of a human in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)

_Take two dates and determine the difference, in seconds, between the two. (This way a user can enter a birthdate and the application can compare the birthdate against the current time to come up with an accurate age.)_


Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet… (yikes!) To do this, the application will have to calculate the user’s life expectancy. (Note that life expectancy shouldn’’t be a hard-coded value. After all, it can vary from country to country and depending on various demographics.)

If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, your application should account for (and test) this possible outcome as well.
